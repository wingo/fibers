;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; (web server) is a web server implementation using Fibers.  Unlike
;;; the standard Guile web server implementation which threads all
;;; handler calls through a single thread, this implementation
;;; allows multiple concurrent handler threads.

  "\"Sanitize\" the given response and body, making them appropriate for
the given request.

As a convenience to web handler authors, RESPONSE may be given as
an alist of headers, in which case it is used to construct a default
response.  Ensures that the response version corresponds to the request
version.  If BODY is a string, encodes the string to a bytevector,
in an encoding appropriate for RESPONSE.  Adds a
‘content-length’ and ‘content-type’ header, as necessary.

If BODY is a procedure, it is called with a port as an argument,
and the output collected as a bytevector.  In the future we might try to
instead use a compressing, chunk-encoded port, and call this procedure
later, in the write-client procedure.  Authors are advised not to rely
on the procedure being called at any particular time."

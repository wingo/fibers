;;; An implementation of Parallel Concurrent ML following the 2009
;;; ICFP paper "Parallel Concurrent ML" by John Reppy, Claudio
;;; V. Russo, and Yingqui Xiao.
;;;
;;; This implementation differs from the paper in a few ways:
;;;
;;; * Superficially, We use the term "operation" instead of "event".
;;;   We say "wrap-operation" instead of "wrap", "choice-operation"
;;;   instead of "choose", and "perform-operation" instead of "sync".
;;;
;;; * For the moment, this is an implementation of "primitive CML"
;;;   only.  This may change in the future.
;;;
;;; * The continuation handling is a little different; in Manticore
;;;   (or at least in the paper), it appears that suspended threads
;;;   are represented in a quite raw way, whereas in Guile there are
;;;   wrapper <fiber> objects.  Likewise unlike in CML, the
;;;   continuations in Fibers are delimited and composable, so things
;;;   are a little different.  Suspended computations expect to be
;;;   passed a thunk as the resume value, and that thunk gets invoked
;;;   in the context of the fiber.  For this reason we represent
;;;   wrappers explicitly in events, using them to wrap the resume
;;;   thunks.  As in the C# implementation, we delay continuation
;;;   creation / fiber suspension until after a failed "doFn" phase.
;;;
;;; * In Fibers we do away with the "poll" phase, instead merging it
;;;   with the "try" phase.  (Our "try" phase is more like what CML
;;;   calls "do".  In Fibers, there is no do; there is only try.)

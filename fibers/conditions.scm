;;; Condition variable (cvar) implementation following the 2009 ICFP
;;; paper "Parallel Concurrent ML" by John Reppy, Claudio V. Russo,
;;; and Yingqui Xiao.  See channels.scm for additional commentary.
;;;
;;; Besides the general ways in which this implementation differs from
;;; the paper, this channel implementation avoids locks entirely.
;;; Still, we should disable interrupts while any operation is in a
;;; "claimed" state to avoid excess latency due to pre-emption.  It
;;; would be great if we could verify our protocol though; the
;;; parallel channel operations are still gnarly.
